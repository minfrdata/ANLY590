Musicians have composed music that has
a precise structure. The goal of this
project is to build a model using neural
networks to generate music which is
similar to human-created pieces. Previous
work has tried various methods such
as Hidden Markov Models, recurrent neural
networks. In our project, we apply
RNNs with long short-term memory cells
on the music notes sequences to predict
the next music notes. With the trained
model, we are able to generate music
pieces. To make the generated music have
better quality, some post-processing techniques
have been used.
